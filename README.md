# tic-tac-toe
This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game can be played by two players, where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The objective is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before the opponent.
